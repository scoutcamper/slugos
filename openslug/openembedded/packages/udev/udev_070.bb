#FIXME UDEV MIGRATION PLAN:
#FIXME      a) udevd is now a netlink daemon and needs to be started by the init script (ours is way too old)
#FIXME      b) sbin/hotplug should no longer be called by the kernel, i.e. echo "" >/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug
#FIXME done c) until d) happens, udev will emulate hotplugd behaviour (see do_install_append()
#FIXME      d) eventually hotplug should no longer be used at all, all agents shall be converted to udev rules
