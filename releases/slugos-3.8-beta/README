This is SlugOS release 3.8 beta

See http://www.nslu2-linux.org

SlugOS builds for a variety of Intel IXP4xx processor based boards and in a
variety of configurations.  Each configuration builds kernels appropriate for
all supported boards.  The configurations currently supported are:

slugos-[bl][at][gu]
	Six working base configurations depending on build endianness, ARM
	instruction set and libc implementation as follows:

	b:	big endian
	l:	little endian

	a:	32-bit ARM instruction set
	t:	16-bit Thumb instruction set (UClibC only)

	g:	GNU libc (glibc) implementation (only supports the ARM
		instruction set.)
	u:	uClibc (see http://www.uclibc.org/) implementation - supports
		both ARM and Thumb executables (which may be mixed in the
		same system).

	The working configurations are four primary supported implementations
	which have package feeds from http://www.nslu2-linux.org

	slugos-bag	(OpenSlug - see below)
	slugos-lag	(DebianSlug - see below)
	slugos-btu	(UcSlugC is a synonym for this)
	slugos-ltu

	and the following two implementations which have had only very limited
	testing:

	slugos-bau
	slugos-lau

openslug
	slugos-bag with a set of utilities in the root file system

debianslug
	slugos-lag with a set of utilities in the root file system

ucslugc
	A synonym for slugos-btu

The tested boards are:

	nslu2	The LinkSys NSLU2
	loft	Variants of the Gateworks GW2348 Avila Network Platform
	ixp4xx	Generic IXDP425 based boards (the kernel will select a platform
		based on the machine ID passed by the boot loader).
	nas100d	The IOMega NAS100D (limited testing, difficult to boot)
	ds101	Synology DS-101 (Not fully supported)

To build this software you require the freely available source code for the
IXP42x Network Processor Engines which are part of the Intel IXP42x processors.
This software can be obtained by following the instructions in the file:

openembedded/packages/ixp4xx/ixp4xx-csr_2.1.bb

The 'downloads' directory which this file refers to should be created in the
same directory as this README file.

To build a particular configuration (referred to as a DISTRO, i.e. a
distribution) after downloading the Intel software type:

make <distro>-image

for example "make openslug-image".

This will build a firmware image in the sub-directory:

<distro>-nslu2.tmp/deploy/images

(The suffix is always 'nslu2' for historical reasons).

The Linux kernel images will be called:

zImage-<board>[le|be]

The root file system will have the extension '.jffs2', a complete (NSLU2 only)
image will have the extension '.img' (not all distros build full images.)

It is also possible to build a complete set of the known-buildable packages:

make <distro>-distro

The packages will be in:

<distro>-nslu2.tmp/deploy/ipk

The source of the built software will be in:

<distro>-nslu2.tmp/work/<package-name>/*
