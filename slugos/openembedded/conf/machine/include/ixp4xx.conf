# conf/${DISTRO}.conf is included after this file and should be used to modify
# variables identified as 'INPUTS' to the required values for the DISTRO, this

#    description

ARCH_BYTE_SEX = "be"
# "be" "le"
#    The memory byte sex and (on correctly implemented hardware - the IXP4XX is
#    correct) the byte sex of the buses within the system.  'be' (big-endian)
#    means that the first byte is the most significant byte on a bus, 'le'
#    (little-endian) means that the first byte is the least significant byte.

ARM_INSTRUCTION_SET = "arm"
# "arm" "thumb"
#    The instruction set the compiler should use when generating application
#    code.  The kernel is always compiled with arm code at present.  arm code
#    is the original 32 bit ARM instruction set, thumb code is the 16 bit
#    encoded RISC sub-set.  Thumb code is smaller (maybe 70% of the ARM size)
#    but requires more instructions (140% for 70% smaller code) so may be
#    slower.

THUMB_INTERWORK = "yes"
# "yes" "no"
#    Whether to compile with code to allow interworking between the two
#    instruction sets.  This allows thumb code to be executed on a primarily
#    arm system and vice versa.  It is strongly recommended that DISTROs not
#    turn this off - the actual cost is very small.

DISTRO_BASE = ""
# "" ":<base>"
#    If given this must be the name of a 'distro' to add to the bitbake OVERRIDES
#    after ${DISTRO}, this allows different distros to share a common base of
#    overrides.  The value given must include a leading ':' or chaos will result.

IXP4XX_SUFFIX = "${MACHINE_ARCH}"
# <string>
#    Kernel suffix - 'ixp4xxbe' or 'ixp4xxle' for a truely generic image, controls
#    the suffix on the name of the generated zImage, override in the DISTRO
#    configuration if patches or defconfig are changed for the DISTRO.

#OVERRIDES
#    The standard ':' separated list of overrides used by bitbake - see the
#    basic setting in bitbake.conf.  This list is based on that used for the
#    standard setting however :<base>, :thumb and :thumb-interwork will be
#    inserted at appropriate points if a base distro, default use of thumb or
#    arm/thumb interworking are enabled in the inputs.

# FULL_OPTIMIZATION

#    not include enough information to allow the debugger to know where given
#    values are.)  The -fno options are an attempt to cancel explicit use of space
